## Introduction to Markdown

`Markdown` is a lightweight markup language that uses very simple characters to control formatting and typesetting. It does not require the effort of using the mouse to typeset like a rich text editor like Word, and the document is in plain text format, making it easy to modify. and version management.

This article mainly introduces how to understand and learn `Markdown` syntax.

## Markdown composition

Markdown generally consists of a **plain text content** and a **renderer**. Plain text is a document written according to `Markdown` syntax. The renderer converts the plain text content into an easy-to-read format such as HTML. tool.

`Markdown` is generally used in two places:
1. Website: When filling in content on a website, if it supports `Markdown` syntax, you can directly use `Markdown` syntax to edit the content. Generally, the preview function will be automatically rendered.
2. Offline tools, such as `Typora`, `VS Code`, etc. These tools generally have preview functions and can render in real time.

The `Markdown` syntax uses special symbols to control the format, such as `#` for the title, `[Text displayed in the link](https://***)` for the link, etc.
