Nowadays, writing machine learning programs does not require us to start from scratch. There are many good frameworks and many useful toolkits

## Pytorch

Official website [pytorch.org](https://pytorch.org/), a framework preferred by the academic community, based on Python syntax, easy to use.

## Tensorflow

The official website [www.tensorflow.org](https://www.tensorflow.org/), a machine learning framework from Google, has built-in `keras` so that developers who are new to AI can get started quickly.
The official website also provides many model examples and tutorials

## Numpy

[Numpy](https://numpy.org/) is a mathematical library, which is usually competent for matrix-related data expression and calculation.

To install the Numpy package, you only need to execute `pip install numpy` to install successfully.

##Opencv
