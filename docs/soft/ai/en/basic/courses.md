This article mainly summarizes some machine learning related resources.

Edits and pull requests are welcome to add.


First of all, you can simply read the first two articles [What is AI? ](./what_is_ai.md) and [Popular Explanation of Deep Learning](./dnn_basic.md) have a general understanding of machine learning in a popular way, and then learn theoretical knowledge.

For developers, code is definitely the best way to get started. It can be understood more quickly. It is also possible to read the tutorial of the training framework and try it first before learning theoretical knowledge.
