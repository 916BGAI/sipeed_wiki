## Overview

  **Tang Console** is an another dock board for **[Tang Mega 138k](./../tang-mega-138k/mega-138k.md) SOM** and **[Tang Mega 60k](./../tang-mega-60k/mega-60k.md) SOM**. It is designed to be small and compact, and is mechanically compatible with the **Raspberry Pi 5b** **`PCIe HAT`**. In addition, it also contains two 5Gbps USB3 device interfaces and two **2x20-pin header connectors**, two **PMOD connectors**. It can meet the needs of IO expansion and high-speed communication at the same time.
  
  At the same time, it is also specially designed for retro games. Maybe you can turn it into a retro game console, or even a handheld, whatever you like.

## Getting Started

Note that **`Tang Mega 60k`** & **`Tang Mega 138k`** is currently not supported by the education version, and you need to download V1.9.11 or a newer version of the commercial IDE for use.  
Lic can be applied on the Gowin official website, or you can use the online Lic service provided by Sipeed. In the IDE, select Float Lic and fill in the following information:

~~~
---Server 01---
ip: 45.33.107.56
port: 10559

---Server 02---
ip: 106.55.34.119
port: 10559
~~~

if the ip not work, try use "gowinlic.sipeed.com" domain's IP.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### How to update the firmware for the onboard debugger

- See [Update the debugger](./../common/update_debugger.md) for details.

### IDE cannot find the model 

1. The educational version does not support 60K and 138K, please switch to the commercial version. The following image shows the educational version (which does not support 60K);
<img src="../assets/questions/no_model_in_IDE.png" width="35%">

2. IDE version is too low to use, update the IDE version â‰¥ **1.9.9**.

### How to burn the bitstream to FLASH {#burn_flash}

1. Setting the **Programmer** as shown in the figure below:

<img src="./../assets/flash_mode_GAO.png" alt="flash_mode" width=35%>

2. Check the position of the DIP switch; the correct position is shown in the figure below:

<img src="./assets/dip-key_defualt.png" alt="dip-key_defualt" width=35%>

### No Response or Undesirable Pin Phenomenon After Burning

1. First, ensure that the IDE has selected the correct model **GW5AT-LV60PG484AC1/10**; every parameter in the figure below **MUST** be consistent.

<img src="./assets/partno_60K.png" alt="device_choose" width=35%>

2. Then, check your code and the corresponding simulation waveforms to meet the requirements. The GAO tools in GOWIN IDE maybe helpful. For more information, please refer to the GOWIN document [SUG100](https://www.gowinsemi.com/upload/database_doc/1885/document/660bb2366d0b3.pdf)(require login).
