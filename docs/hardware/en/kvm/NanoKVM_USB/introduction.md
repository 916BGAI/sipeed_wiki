## Introduction

![](./../../../assets/NanoKVM/usb/NanoKVM-USB.png)

The NanoKVM-USB is a convenient tool for operations and multi-device collaboration. It allows you to perform maintenance tasks without the need for a keyboard, mouse, or monitor. Using just a single computer and no additional software downloads, you can start graphical operations directly through the Chrome browser.

NanoKVM-USB captures HDMI video signals and transmits them to the host via USB 3.0. Unlike typical USB capture cards, NanoKVM-USB also captures keyboard and mouse input from the host and sends it to the target machine in real-time, eliminating the need for traditional screen and peripheral connections. It also supports HDMI loop-out, with a maximum resolution of 4K@30Hz, making it easy to connect to a large display.

Notably, NanoKVM-USB comes with a USB-A port that supports switching between HOST and TARGET sides. When a USB drive is connected, data can be easily transferred between two computers. Additional features can be explored freely.
